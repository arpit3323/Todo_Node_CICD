                                Complete Step-by-Step Jenkins CICD with GitHub Integration

Overview:

CI/CD is a way to introduce automation during app development stages and deliver apps to customers in bulk. The basic concepts of CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.

Thus, CI/CD has become an integral part of the software development cycle, with many frameworks and tools available. We will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud platform, GitHub for code repositories, Jenkins for Continuous Integration (CI), and Continuous Delivery (CD).


Requirements:

AWS account.
Jenkins and Docker are to be installed on the AWS EC2 Instance
GitHub repo (code)

Step 1: Setup AWS EC2 Instance
We will first create an AWS Instance (Ubuntu) free-tier eligible using the AWS console.

Steps To launch the EC2 instance:
Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
Choose Launch Instance.
